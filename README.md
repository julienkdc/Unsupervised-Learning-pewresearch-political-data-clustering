# Summary
This code looks for the best dimensionality reduction algorithms to represent the political dataset from pewresearch. The dataset, from a 2016 survey, collects various information from United States citizens and where they stand on certain issues. Classifying a citizen as either a Democrat or a Republican is misleading. Therfore this code looks at the use of PCA and t-SNE clustering to find better label groups for the population.
